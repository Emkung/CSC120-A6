- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I think I really like how inherentence works. I like how I can just make a model and base the rest of my classses on it. Therefore, I really like it. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Always ask your friends and professors for help when you are struggling, I know sometimes it is really hard to do so, but doing so would almost always help. So please, when you are struggling, seek help.
